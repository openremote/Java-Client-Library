     | Checks that classes that define a covariant equals() method also override method

     | Checks cyclomatic complexity against a specified limit. The complexity is measured by the
     | number of if, while, do, for, ?:, catch, switch, case statements, and operators &&
     | and || (plus one) in the body of a constructor, method, static initializer, or
     | instance initializer. It is a measure of the minimum number of possible paths through
     | the source and therefore the number of required tests. Generally 1-4 is considered good,
     | 5-7 ok, 8-10 consider re-factoring, and 11+ re-factor now!

     | Checks that classes that override equals() also override hashCode(). The contract of

     | With the exception of for iterators, all assignments should occur in their own toplevel
     | statement to increase readability. With inner assignments like the above it is difficult
     | to see all places where a variable is set.

         Ignore code lines that start with white space characters (zero or more : '^\s*')

         Also ignores Javadoc lines that contain a single, non-spaced word. Any line that starts
         with white space characters (zero or more, '^\s*') followed by a '*' character that itself
         is followed by zero or one whitespace, then any number of characters before a next
         whitespace character(s) ('\*\s.*\s*'), is allowed. This ignores Javadoc lines that contain
         a singe long URL for example. In addition, allow a html tag to be included at the end of
         such a long line, for example a paragraph tag. This is added as a group that can contain
         the less than character (specified in unicode value '\u003C' to avoid conflicts with XML
         illegal characters) followed by at least one but at least most 5 characters ('[a-zA-Z]{1,5}')
         and finally the ending greater than character in unicode '\u003E. The whole group can be
         present either zero times or at most once ('{0,1}').
